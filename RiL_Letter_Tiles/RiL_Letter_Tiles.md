## Overview
Rooted in Language (RiL) Letter Tiles provides an easy, powerful, and hands-on learning experience for developing language skills. The app uses a digital tile-based system, reminiscent of classic word-building exercises, to help users with spelling, phonics, morphology, and sentence construction in an interactive and engaging way. Its flexible, open-ended design makes it a powerful tool for students, teachers, and therapists alike.

## Features
* **Interactive Tile-Based Learning**: A tactile, drag-and-drop interface that makes learning feel hands-on.
* **Comprehensive Sound Tiles**: Includes tiles for all phonograms, with multiple grapheme options for each sound.
* **Morphology Tools**: Dedicated tiles for prefixes, suffixes, and operators (+, → ) to explore word changes.
* **Sound Segmentation Plates**: Use dedicated plates to isolate sounds in a word, reinforcing phonemic awareness.
* **Integrated Handwriting Practice**: Add writing lines to any sound plate to practice letter formation.
* **Fully Customizable**: Edit tile trays to hide or show specific tiles, and create your own custom tiles for any purpose.
* **Auditory Feedback**: Reinforce learning by hearing the sounds of letters and phonograms with a single tap.
* **Clean, Kid-Friendly Design**: A simple and inviting interface to keep learners focused.
* **Offline Functionality**: All core features are available without an internet connection, making it perfect for learning on the go.

## Installation

### Mobile (Android/iOS)
1.  Download RiL Letter Tiles from your device's app store.

## How to Use

The Rooted in Language Curricula inspired the all the features, but the app is designed as an open-ended workspace. There is no rigid menu system; you build the learning experience directly on the screen. 

### The Workspace
* **Main Workspace**: The large, central area where you can freely place and arrange tiles.
* **Plates**: The numbered slots at the top of the workspace. Use the **+** and **-** buttons to set the number of plates (0-16) to match the number of sounds in a word.
* **Tile Trays**: Tap the **Sounds**, **Affixes**, or **Misc** buttons to open trays containing different tile collections.
* **Trash (🗑️)**: Drag unwanted tiles here to remove them from the workspace.
* **Clear All**: Tap this button to instantly clear the entire workspace and all plates.

### Core Activity 1: Working with Sounds
This is the primary exercise for phonics and spelling.

1.  **Set Up the Plates**: For a word like "sheep," which has 3 sounds (/sh/, /ee/, /p/), tap the **+** button until you have 3 plates.
2.  **Find the Sound Tiles**:
    * Tap the **Sounds** tray to open it.
    * Find the tiles for each sound. Some tiles represent multiple letters (e.g., `sh`, `ee`).
    * **Pro Tip**: If a sound has multiple spellings (e.g., the long /e/ sound can be `ee`, `ea`, `ey`), you can tap the main sound tile to reveal all its associated grapheme tiles.
3.  **Place the Tiles**: Long-press a tile to pick it up, drag it to a plate, and release. Place `sh` on plate 1, `ee` on plate 2, and `p` on plate 3.
4.  **Practice with Push-Pull**: To blend the sounds, drag the `sh` tile up and say its sound. Drag it back down silently. Repeat for `ee` and `p`. This helps connect the visual tile to its sound and position in the word.
5.  **Practice Handwriting**: Tap the bottom area of any plate to reveal writing lines. Use your finger or a stylus to practice writing the letters on the lines. Tap again to hide them.

### Core Activity 2: Building Words with Affixes
Explore how prefixes and suffixes change base words.

1.  **Place a Base Word**: Drag tiles from the **Sounds** tray to the main workspace (not the plates) to spell a base word, like "play".
2.  **Add an Affix**:
    * Open the **Affixes** tray.
    * Find a suffix tile, like `ing`.
    * Drag the `ing` tile and place it next to "play" to form "playing".
    * Experiment with other prefixes and suffixes to see how the word's meaning changes.

### Advanced Tools and Customization

#### Specialized Tiles
In the **Misc** tray, you will find operator tiles (like $+$, $-->$, etc.). These are used for more advanced grammar and morphology exercises based on the Rooted in Language curriculum, such as word sums and transformations.

#### Creating Custom Tiles
You can create your own tiles for any purpose.
1.  Open any tile tray (**Sounds**, **Affixes**, or **Misc**).
2.  Tap **Edit Tray**.
3.  Here you can hide tiles you don't need or tap the 'Create New' button to design your own tile with custom text and color. This is perfect for focusing on specific words, names, or concepts.

## FAQ

**What is the purpose of this app?**
RiL Letter Tiles is a digital tool designed to make language learning interactive and effective. It uses a flexible tile system to help users practice phonics, spelling, and morphology in a hands-on, multi-sensory way.

**Who is this app for?**
The app is ideal for early language learners, students with dyslexia, and individuals of any age who benefit from a hands-on approach to language practice. It is also a powerful tool for teachers, tutors, and speech-language pathologists.

**How do the tiles work?**
Each tile represents a sound (phonogram) or a part of a word (morpheme). You can drag them from a tile tray to a workspace or sound plate to build words. Tapping a tile plays its sound, reinforcing the grapheme-phoneme connection.

**Can I create my own word lists or tiles?**
Yes. While the app comes with a comprehensive set of pre-built tiles, you can use the **Edit Tray** feature to create your own custom tiles. This allows you to tailor lessons and practice specific word lists or concepts.

**Does the app track my progress?**
The app is designed as a flexible tool for practice and reinforcement rather than a linear game. It does not include formal progress tracking or reporting features, which may be considered for future enhancements.

**Does the app require an internet connection?**
No. Once the app is installed, all core learning activities are available offline, so you can learn anytime, anywhere.
