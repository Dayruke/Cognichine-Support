## FAQ

**What's the purpose of this app?**  
The app helps visualize the proportional difference between two numbers, making abstract numerical comparisons more intuitive and understandable.

**Can I compare very different values?**  
Yes! The app automatically scales the shapes to show the proportion between values, no matter how different they are.

**What do the "Together" and "Apart" options do?**  
- **Together**: Shapes touch at the middle line, emphasizing their connection.  
- **Apart**: Shapes are centered in their respective areas, making individual sizes clearer.

**How do I save my settings?**  
After customizing shapes and colors, tap the "SAVE" button in the settings menu to store your preferences.

**Can I restore my previous settings?**  
Yes, if you've saved settings previously, a "LOAD" button will appear in the settings menu to restore them.

**What if I enter zero for both values?**  
Both shapes will disappear until you enter non-zero values.

**Is there a limit to the values I can enter?**  
The calculator supports standard numerical ranges. For practical visualization, extremely large ratios may show one shape as very small compared to the other.

**Can I use this app offline?**  
Yes, the app works completely offline once installed.
